## Overview

The Steam Game Price and Review Insight Portal aggregates historical pricing and user review data for ~85 Steam titles and presents it through a modern, dark-themed dashboard. Users can browse games by category, drill into individual game analytics, compare titles side-by-side, and receive data-driven purchase recommendations. An AI chatbot translates natural-language questions into live SQL queries against the database and returns human-readable answers.

---

## Key Features

- **Dashboard** -- Card-based grid layout with real-time statistics, category browsing, and global search.
- **Game Detail Pages** -- Price history line charts, review sentiment bar charts, discount badges, and recommendation breakdowns.
- **Buy Score Engine** -- Composite 0-100 score blending price positioning and review sentiment with adaptive weighting.
- **Game Comparison** -- Side-by-side comparison of two games across price, discount, reviews, and buy score with an overall verdict.
- **ML Clustering** -- K-Means clustering assigns games into Budget Hits, Standard Tier, and Premium Titles; anomaly detection flags hidden gems.
- **AI Chatbot** -- RAG pipeline powered by LLaMA 3.1 via HuggingFace, with LangChain orchestration and FastAPI serving.
- **Insight Queries** -- Pre-built analytical questions (cheapest game, biggest price drop, highest-reviewed) filterable by category.
- **User Accounts** -- Registration, login, session-based authentication, wishlists, and shopping carts.

---

## Prerequisites

- **XAMPP** with Apache and MySQL enabled
- **PHP 7.4** or higher
- **MySQL / MariaDB** (bundled with XAMPP)
- **Python 3.9+** (required only for the AI chatbot)
- **A HuggingFace API token** (required only for the AI chatbot)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lazyflash99/steam-price-tracker-portal.git
```

Copy the `steam_Tracker` folder into your XAMPP `htdocs` directory:

```
C:\xampp\htdocs\steam_Tracker\
```

### 2. Start XAMPP Services

Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start **Apache** and **MySQL**.

### 3. Create the Database

1. Open **phpMyAdmin** at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`
2. Create a new database named `steam_tracker`
3. The required tables (`games`, `price_history`, `review_history`, `users`, `wishlist`, `cart`) are **auto-created** by `includes/db.php` on first page load

If you prefer to create them manually, see the [Database Schema](#database-schema) section below.

### 4. Configure the Database Connection

The default connection in `includes/db.php` is:

| Parameter | Default Value   |
| --------- | --------------- |
| Host      | `localhost`     |
| Username  | `root`          |
| Password  | *(empty)*       |
| Database  | `steam_tracker` |

If your MySQL credentials differ, update the `mysqli_connect()` call in `includes/db.php`.

### 5. Import Game Data

1. Ensure CSV data files are placed in the `steam_Tracker/data/` directory
2. Navigate to `http://localhost/steam_Tracker/import.php`
3. Click **Start Import** to load all CSV data into the database
4. Optionally, navigate to `http://localhost/steam_Tracker/ml_engine.php` to run the clustering engine

### 6. Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost/steam_Tracker/
```

---

## Database Schema

The application uses six tables. The `games`, `users`, `wishlist`, and `cart` tables are auto-created by `includes/db.php`. The `price_history` and `review_history` tables are implicitly created during the import process.

```sql
-- Core game catalog
CREATE TABLE games (
    id            INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name          VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    category      VARCHAR(500),
    cluster_label VARCHAR(100),
    is_anomaly    BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

-- Historical price data (one row per game per date)
CREATE TABLE price_history (
    id         INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    game_id    INT NOT NULL REFERENCES games(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    price_date DATE NOT NULL,
    price      DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL
);

-- Historical review counts (one row per game per month)
CREATE TABLE review_history (
    id          INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    game_id     INT NOT NULL REFERENCES games(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    review_date DATE NOT NULL,
    pos_reviews INT DEFAULT 0,
    neg_reviews INT DEFAULT 0
);

-- User accounts
CREATE TABLE users (
    id            INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username      VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at    TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- User wishlists
CREATE TABLE wishlist (
    id       INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id  INT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    game_id  INT NOT NULL REFERENCES games(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    added_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE KEY uq_wishlist (user_id, game_id)
);

-- User shopping carts
CREATE TABLE cart (
    id       INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id  INT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    game_id  INT NOT NULL REFERENCES games(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    added_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE KEY uq_cart (user_id, game_id)
);
```

## Data Import

The import system (`import.php`) scans the `data/` directory for CSV files matching one of two naming patterns:

| File Type      | Pattern                      | CSV Columns                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Price history  | `GameName_AppID_prices.csv`  | `date, price`                              |
| Review history | `GameName_AppID_reviews.csv` | `date, pos_reviews, neg_reviews, category` |

The importer automatically creates game entries in the `games` table if they do not already exist, and populates `price_history` and `review_history` with the time-series data. Category tags are extracted from the review CSV and stored as pipe-delimited strings (e.g., `Action|Adventure|Survival`).

All prices in the dataset are denominated in **Indian Rupees (INR)**.

---

## Running the Application

1. Start Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP Control Panel
2. Navigate to `http://localhost/steam_Tracker/` in your browser
3. If the database is empty, go to **Sync Data** to import CSV files
4. Run the **ML Engine** to generate cluster labels and detect hidden gems
5. Browse games, view detailed analytics, compare titles, and explore insights

---

## AI Chatbot Setup

The AI chatbot requires a separate Python server to be running alongside the PHP application.

### 1. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
cd steam_Tracker/rag
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `rag/` directory:

```env
HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_api_token
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=steam_tracker
```

You can obtain a HuggingFace API token from [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens). The token must have access to the `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct` model.

### 3. Start the RAG Server

```bash
cd steam_Tracker/rag
python chatbot_api.py
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:8000` by default. Verify it is running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### 4. Use the Chatbot

Navigate to `http://localhost/steam_Tracker/chatbot.php` in your browser. The chatbot translates natural-language questions into SQL, executes them against the live database, and returns synthesized answers. Example queries:

- "What is the lowest price for Hollow Knight?"
- "Which game has the highest positive reviews?"
- "Compare Baldur's Gate 3 and Hades II. Which should I buy?"
- "Show me all Action games under 1000 rupees"

The RAG pipeline includes SQL injection prevention via a forbidden-statement filter and query validation.

## Buy Score Algorithm

The Buy Score is a composite metric (0--100) that blends two signals:

### Price Score (0--100)

Evaluates the current price relative to the game's historical price range:

| Condition                                         | Score                          |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Current price at or below all-time low            | 100                            |
| Current price above the midpoint of min/max range | 20                             |
| Current price between low and midpoint            | 20--100 (linear interpolation) |

### Review Score (0--100)

Directly uses the positive review percentage (`positive / total * 100`).

### Adaptive Blending

The final score uses sentiment-aware weights that shift emphasis depending on community reception:

| Sentiment Bracket              | Review Weight | Price Weight |
| ------------------------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| Overwhelmingly Positive (95%+) | 0.75          | 0.25         |
| Very Positive (80--94%)        | 0.65          | 0.35         |
| Positive (65--79%)             | 0.55          | 0.45         |
| Mixed (50--64%)                | 0.45          | 0.55         |
| Negative (30--49%)             | 0.35          | 0.65         |
| Overwhelmingly Negative (<30%) | 0.25          | 0.75         |

### Score Labels

| Score Range | Label         |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| 85--100     | Excellent Buy |
| 70--84      | Good Value    |
| 55--69      | Fair Deal     |
| 35--54      | Wait a Bit    |
| 0--34       | Avoid         |

### Backtest Validation

To check whether the Buy-Score is actually informative -- rather than just a
plausible-looking number -- `buy_score_backtest.py` re-computes the score on
every historical date for every game using **only the data available at that
date** (no look-ahead), then measures how much the price actually fell over the
following 60 days. A useful score should fire "Excellent Buy" right before a
price floor (low future drop) and "Wait a Bit" right before a price drop (high
future drop).

The portal tracks the full ~85-title catalogue, but the headline validation
figure below is pinned to a **fixed 48-title validation subset**
(`validation_appids.txt`) so it stays reproducible as the catalogue grows.
By default the backtest runs on that subset; pass `--all` to score the full
catalogue instead (a larger, slightly weaker `r ~ -0.64` over ~2.6k samples).

```bash
python buy_score_backtest.py --horizon 60          # fixed validation subset
python buy_score_backtest.py --horizon 60 --all    # full ~85-title catalogue
```

Results on the validation subset (47 games, 1707 point-in-time samples):

| Recommendation  |    n | Median future discount missed | Rate of >=5% future drop |
|-----------------|-----:|------------------------------:|-------------------------:|
| Excellent Buy   |  473 |  **0.00%**                    |          **14.8%**       |
| Good Value      |  492 |   20.08%                      |           61.0%          |
| Fair Deal       |  387 |   50.01%                      |           82.7%          |
| Wait a Bit      |  205 |   67.02%                      |           90.7%          |
| Avoid           |  150 |   70.19%                      |           68.7%          |

* Spearman correlation between Buy-Score and 60-day future discount missed:
  **r = -0.66** (strong negative, exactly as expected -- higher score means
  smaller subsequent price drop).
* "Excellent Buy" calls miss almost no future discount; "Wait a Bit" calls
  correctly predict a typical ~67% future drop with a 91% hit rate.
* "Avoid" has a lower hit rate than "Wait a Bit" because it fires on
  poorly-reviewed games whose prices are already stable / rarely discounted
  further -- the sentiment side of the score dominates that bucket.

Per-sample detail is written to `buy_score_backtest_results.csv`.

---

## ML Engine

The ML Engine page (`ml_engine.php`) performs two operations:

### K-Means Clustering

Games are clustered into three tiers using Z-score normalized price and review sentiment data. The algorithm dynamically initializes centroids based on the 33rd and 66th percentiles of the dataset.

- **Budget Hits**: Bottom 33% by price
- **Standard Tier**: Middle 33% by price
- **Premium Titles**: Top 33% by price

The clustering enforces hard price boundaries, while K-Means iterations are run purely on the sentiment Z-score within each band to group games by community reception. Cluster labels are persisted in the `games` table and used by the recommendation engine.

### Anomaly Detection (Hidden Gems)

Hidden Gems are detected dynamically *per cluster* rather than using global thresholds. A game qualifies as a hidden gem if it meets both of the following criteria within its cluster:
1. **Exceptional Reception**: Review sentiment is greater than or equal to the cluster's mean sentiment plus 0.75 standard deviations.
2. **Value Pricing**: Price is at or below the cluster's median price (excluding free games).

This surfaces affordable, highly-rated titles that punch above their weight relative to their direct peers.

## Security Considerations

- All user-facing output is escaped with `htmlspecialchars()` to prevent XSS
- Passwords are stored using PHP's `password_hash()` with bcrypt
- Session-based authentication with server-side session management
- The RAG pipeline filters generated SQL through a forbidden-statement regex that blocks `DROP`, `DELETE`, `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, `ALTER`, `CREATE`, `TRUNCATE`, and other mutating keywords
- Generated queries are validated to ensure they begin with `SELECT` and reference only known tables

---

## Troubleshooting

**Database connection errors**
Confirm MySQL is running in the XAMPP Control Panel. Verify the credentials in `includes/db.php` match your MySQL configuration.

**Empty dashboard after setup**
Navigate to Sync Data (`import.php`) and click Start Import. Ensure CSV files are present in the `data/` directory.

**Game images not displaying**
Verify that header images exist in `steam_game_headers_by_name/` with filenames matching the exact game name in the database (case-sensitive). Only `.jpg` format is supported.

**Charts not rendering**
